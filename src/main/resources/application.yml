          #for your authorization server. It's usually listed in its documentation. 
          #The URL you used above is the issuer for a Keycloak authorization server, pointing at a realm named "one".
          #Included in the project is a docker-compose setup for Keycloak which creates a realm called one at startup. 
          #So, while you could point this at any authorization server, this specific URL simplifies local verification.
